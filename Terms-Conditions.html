            <li>reference to this agreement includes reference to the front sheet, schedules and appendices and other documents 
                attached to it or incorporated by reference into it (all as amended or added to from time to time);</li>
            <li> reference to any legislation shall be to that legislation as amended, extended or re-enacted from time to time and
                 to any subordinate provision made under that legislation;</li>

        </ol>
      </div>

    <h3 class="fw-bold " style="color: #196d73;">2. These terms</h3>
    <p>2.1 These Terms shall be deemed to have been accepted by the Client and to apply by virtue of (a) an Introduction to or the 
        Engagement by the Client of a Candidate; or (b) the passing of information about the Candidate by the Client to any third 
        party; or (c) the Client’s interview or request to interview a Candidate; or (d) any written (including email or text) or 
        other express acceptance of these Terms; or (e) the signature by the Client of a timesheet or invoice of a Temporary, 
        whichever first occurs. For the avoidance of doubt these Terms apply whether or not the Candidate is Engaged for the same
         type of work as that for which the Introduction was originally effected.</p>
       <p>2.2 The Client agrees that Candid page' Introduction will be the effective cause of any Engagement and the fee or fees
         (as appropriate) in accordance with these Terms will be charged and payable, if the Candidate becomes a Permanent
          Candidate or a Fixed-Term Candidate and the Client has:</p>  
        <p>(a) not notified Candid page within 48 hours of the relevant Introduction that the Candidate is already known to the
             Client and/or has already been introduced to the Client by another employment agency or business and not provided 
             Candid pages, within such 48 hour period, with satisfactory evidence of the same and with satisfactory evidence that 
             the Candidate was identified to the Client with the Candidate's prior consent (and Candid page reserves the right to

              binding); or</p>
         <p>(b) notified Candid page within the period set out in clause 2.2(a) that the Candidate is already known to the Client
             and, within such period, has provided Candid page with the satisfactory evidence set out in clause 2.2(a), but the
              Client does not, within such period, provide Candid page with satisfactory evidence that the Client has been in 
              contact with the Candidate regarding relevant vacancies within the 3 months prior to the relevant Introduction.</p>
         <p>For the avoidance of doubt, Candid page shall always be entitled to charge the Client fees (in accordance with these 
            Terms) for the supply of a Temporary.</p>     
         <p>2.3 These Terms contain the entire agreement between the parties in relation to the subject matter and unless otherwise
             agreed in writing (and signed by a duly authorised signatory), these Terms prevail over any previous terms of business,
              agreement or any purchase conditions put forward by the Client. This clause is without prejudice to any rights which 
              have arisen prior to the termination of such and nothing shall operate to exclude or limit the liability of any party
               in respect of fraud.</p>
          <p>2.4 If an Assignment Schedule conflicts with the provisions of these terms, then the provisions of that Assignment
             Schedule will take precedence in relation to the Services to be supplied in accordance with that Assignment Schedule.</p>
         <p>2.5 If there is any dispute, conflict or inconsistency between these Terms and any Assignment Schedule or duly 
            authorised variation to these Terms, the provisions of those documents shall, only to the extent of any such conflict 
            or inconsistency, take precedence in the following order:</p>
            <div>
                <ol>
                    <li> an individual Assignment Schedule;</li>
                    <li> the latest agreement amendment form varying the terms of this agreement; and</li>
                    <li> the Terms of this agreement.</li>

         <h3 class="fw-bold " style="color: #2d2e2e;">4.Permanent and Fixed-Term Recruitment Services Fee</h3>
         <p>4.1The Client shall notify Fresh Minds immediately the Client Engages the Candidate as a Permanent Candidate or a Fixed-Term Candidate.</p>
        <p>4.2The Permanent and Fixed-Term Recruitment Services Fee shall be due if the Client Engages a Permanent Candidate or a Fixed-Term Candidate at any time in the 12 months following the Introduction of the Permanent Candidate or Fixed-Term Candidate.</p>
        <p>4.3In the case of a Permanent Candidate, the Permanent and Fixed-Term Recruitment Services Fee is calculated as a percentage of the Permanent Candidate's annual Remuneration in accordance with the applicable Rate Card in Schedule 2 (subject always to a minimum fee of £6,000) and, in the case of a Fixed-Term Candidate, the Permanent and Fixed-Term Recruitment Services Fee will be negotiated and agreed between Fresh Minds and the Client on a case by case basis (subject always to a minimum fee of £6,000).</p>
        <p>4.4Where in accordance with the terms of this agreement Fresh Minds is providing the relevant Permanent and Fixed-Term Recruitment Services on a retained basis, the Client will pay Fresh Minds the Permanent and Fixed-Term Recruitment Services Fee in the following instalments:</p>
        <div>
          <ol>
            <li>one third upon Fresh Minds' acceptance of the Client's instructions;</li>
            <li>the final balance upon the date of commencement of the Candidate's Engagement with the Client, save that Fresh Minds will increase or reduce the amount of such final balance if necessary if the first instalment was based on a Permanent and Fixed-Term Recruitment Services Fee calculated on the basis of anticipated instead of actual Remuneration.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <p>4.5The Client shall pay Fresh Minds the Permanent and Fixed-Term Recruitment Services Fee or any instalment within 30 days of the date of Fresh Minds' invoice.</p>
        <p>4.6Provided that the Client has paid the Permanent Services Fee in full in accordance with paragraphs 4.1 to 4.5 above, then if:</p>
        <div>
          <ol>
            <li>the Candidate who was the subject of the Permanent Services Fee terminates the Engagement voluntarily or is justifiably dismissed for unsatisfactory work or gross misconduct; and</li>
            <li>the Client notified Fresh Minds within 14 days of such termination or dismissal;</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <p>provided that such termination or dismissal is not as a result of redundancy, reorganisation, injury or ill-health or any unlawful discrimination under the Equality Act 2010, nor is such termination or dismissal by reason of a dismissal classed as an automatic unfair dismissal by virtue of the Employment Rights Act , then Fresh Minds shall provide the Client with a refund of the Permanent Services Fee on a pro-rata basis as follows:</p>
          <p>Rebates in the case of Fixed-Term Candidates, or Permanent Candidates sourced via a retained search shall not be subject to these refunds.Any refunds for retained searches will be payable only in relation to the final instalment of the Permanent Services Fee paid in accordance with paragraph 4.4(c) above and not, for the avoidance of doubt, in relation to the first instalment of the Permanent Services Fee paid in accordance with paragraphs 4.4(a) and (b) above.No rebates will be paid for Fixed-Term Candidates unless specifically agreed on a case-by-case basis.</p>
          
          <h3 class="fw-bold " style="color: #2d2e2e;">Schedule 2: Rate Cards</h3>
          <p>In relation to Permanent and Fixed-Term Recruitment Services, the parties will have agreed whether Fresh Minds will act on either a retained or non-retained basis in accordance with the following rate cards.</p>
         <p>In relation to Temporary Recruitment Services:</p>
         <p>where the Remuneration is known, the Transfer Fee or the Introduction Fee (as applicable) will be calculated as a percentage of the Remuneration based on the amount of experience of the Candidate as set out in Rate Card 1; and</p>
         <p>where the Remuneration is not known, the Transfer Fee or the Introduction Fee (as applicable) will be calculated by multiplying the Candidate’s hourly or daily rate (whichever is applicable to the Candidate and as set out in the relevant Assignment Schedule or, where such rate is not set out in the relevant Assignment Schedule, the current market rate) by a set percentage based on the amount of experience of the Candidate as set out in Rate Card 1.</p>

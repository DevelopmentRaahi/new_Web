            <li> reference to a person includes a legal person (such as a limited company) as well as a natural person;</li>
            <li>reference to this agreement includes reference to the front sheet, schedules and appendices and other documents 
                attached to it or incorporated by reference into it (all as amended or added to from time to time);</li>
            <li> reference to any legislation shall be to that legislation as amended, extended or re-enacted from time to time and
                 to any subordinate provision made under that legislation;</li>

               references to this agreement shall include reference to it after it has been amended, added to or replaced by a new 
               agreement.</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

    <h2 class="fw-bold " style="color: #196d73;">2. these terms</h2>
    <p>2.1 These Terms shall be deemed to have been accepted by the Client and to apply by virtue of (a) an Introduction to or the 
        Engagement by the Client of a Candidate; or (b) the passing of information about the Candidate by the Client to any third 
        party; or (c) the Client’s interview or request to interview a Candidate; or (d) any written (including email or text) or 
        other express acceptance of these Terms; or (e) the signature by the Client of a timesheet or invoice of a Temporary, 
        whichever first occurs. For the avoidance of doubt these Terms apply whether or not the Candidate is Engaged for the same
         type of work as that for which the Introduction was originally effected.</p>
       <p>2.2 The Client agrees that Candid page' Introduction will be the effective cause of any Engagement and the fee or fees
         (as appropriate) in accordance with these Terms will be charged and payable, if the Candidate becomes a Permanent
          Candidate or a Fixed-Term Candidate and the Client has:</p>  
        <p>(a) not notified Candid page within 48 hours of the relevant Introduction that the Candidate is already known to the
             Client and/or has already been introduced to the Client by another employment agency or business and not provided 
             Candid pages, within such 48 hour period, with satisfactory evidence of the same and with satisfactory evidence that 
             the Candidate was identified to the Client with the Candidate's prior consent (and Candid page reserves the right to
              ask the Candidate whether or not the Candidate gave such consent and the Candidate's response shall be final and 
              binding); or</p>
         <p>(b) notified Candid page within the period set out in clause 2.2(a) that the Candidate is already known to the Client
             and, within such period, has provided Candid page with the satisfactory evidence set out in clause 2.2(a), but the
              Client does not, within such period, provide Candid page with satisfactory evidence that the Client has been in 
              contact with the Candidate regarding relevant vacancies within the 3 months prior to the relevant Introduction.</p>
         <p>For the avoidance of doubt, Candid page shall always be entitled to charge the Client fees (in accordance with these 
            Terms) for the supply of a Temporary.</p>     
         <p>2.3 These Terms contain the entire agreement between the parties in relation to the subject matter and unless otherwise
             agreed in writing (and signed by a duly authorised signatory), these Terms prevail over any previous terms of business,
              agreement or any purchase conditions put forward by the Client. This clause is without prejudice to any rights which 
              have arisen prior to the termination of such and nothing shall operate to exclude or limit the liability of any party
               in respect of fraud.</p>
          <p>2.4 If an Assignment Schedule conflicts with the provisions of these terms, then the provisions of that Assignment
             Schedule will take precedence in relation to the Services to be supplied in accordance with that Assignment Schedule.</p>
         <p>2.5 If there is any dispute, conflict or inconsistency between these Terms and any Assignment Schedule or duly 
            authorised variation to these Terms, the provisions of those documents shall, only to the extent of any such conflict 
            or inconsistency, take precedence in the following order:</p>
            <div>
                <ol>
                    <li> an individual Assignment Schedule;</li>
                    <li> the latest agreement amendment form varying the terms of this agreement; and</li>
                    <li> the Terms of this agreement.x</li>

          <h2>Where do we collect personal data about you from?</h2>   
          <p>The following are the different sources we may collect personal data about you from:</p>
          <p>Directly from you: if you provide us with your CV and contact details together with any other personal data, based 
            either on your consent or on a contract between us.</p>
          <p>From an agent/third party acting on your behalf: if a client contacts us and asks us to invite you to interview or 
            consider a job opportunity, if you are referred to us by a partner for a role we are seeking to fill. In this event,
             our processing is done initially based on our legitimate interests and subsequently may be based on consent or contract.</p>
           <p>Through publicly available sources: Where we collect your information through publicly available sources as set out 
            above, we may do this with the aid of software programs. These programs are given parameters on the requirements of a 
            role and search through publicly available sources to find such candidates. These programs are designed to only output
             information on candidates that meet the search criteria. The parameters of this program are restricted to only 
             searching for [Name, Age and Job role] candidate information from public sites where it is our understanding (based 
             on our reasonable endeavours used to research the public source) that such information is provided by the candidate 
             (data subject) based on their consent that their personal data may be collected and further processed by job 
             recruiters for the purpose of sourcing candidates for different opportunities</p>
           <p>By reference or word of mouth: where a client or an agent on your behalf provides us with your personal data with a
             recommendation or a reference for a post.</p>  
            <p>This website may include links to third-party websites, plug-ins and applications. Clicking on those links or 
              enabling those connections may allow third parties to collect or share data about you. We do not control these
               third-party websites and are not responsible for their privacy statements. When you leave our website, we encourage 
               you to read the privacy policy of every website you visit.</p> 

          <h2>How and why we use your personal data?</h2>     
          <p>We use your personal data to match your skills, experience and education with potential employers or those clients 
            looking to bring in extra capacity to fulfil a project requirement. We will initially collect basic information on 
            you, such as contact details, job role, CV and experience via our website and at a face-to-face interview with you 
            where possible, based either on your consent or the contract between us. We will then pass this on to the client in
             search of personnel. If you are chosen by the client and go through to the next stage we will then request further
              information from you at the interview (or equivalent) stage, again based on your consent or a contract between us.</p>
          <p>We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law.</p>
          <p>We also collect, use and share Aggregated Data such as statistical or demographic data for any purpose. Aggregated 
            Data could be derived from your personal data but is not considered personal data in law as this data will <b>not</b> directly
             or indirectly reveal your identity.</p>

        <h2>Marketing</h2>
        <p>We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain personal data uses, particularly around marketing and advertising.</p>
       <p>We may use your personal data to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. 
        This is how we decide which products, services and offers may be relevant for you. We do this based on our legitimate 
        interests (which we balance against your rights) or with your consent where you request information.</p>
        <p>You will also receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information from us or if you have used our 
          services in the past and have not opted out of receiving that marketing.</p>
          <p>We will get your express opt-in consent before we share your personal data with any third party for marketing purposes.</p>

       <h2>Opting out</h2>
       <p>You can ask us (or third parties) to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by contacting us at any time or by 
        using the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of our marketing messages.</p>
        <p>Where you opt out of receiving these marketing messages, this will not apply to personal data provided to us for the provision of services where our legal basis for using the personal data is based on contract, not consent.</p>
 
      <h2>How long do we keep your personal data for?</h2>
      <p>We usually keep your information as follows:</p>
      <p><b>Candidate data:</b> 6 years from last contact.</p>
      <p>We only retain personal data for as long as is necessary for us to use your information as described above or to comply 
        with our legal obligations. However, please be advised that we may retain some of your information after you cease to use 
        our services, for instance, if this is necessary to meet our legal obligations, such as retaining the information for tax 
        and accounting purposes.</p>
        <p>When determining the relevant retention periods, we will take into account factors including:</p>
         <ol>
          <li> our contractual obligations and rights in relation to the information involved;</li>
          <li>   legal obligation(s) under applicable law to retain data for a certain period of time;</li>
          <li>  statute of limitations under applicable law(s);</li>
          <li>     (potential) disputes;</li>
          <li>   if you have made a request to have your information deleted; and</li>
          <li>guidelines issued by relevant data protection authorities.</li>
             </ol>
             <p>In some circumstances, we will anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for 
              research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</p>
             <p>Otherwise, we securely erase your information once this is no longer needed.</p>
 
        <h2>Who do we share your personal data with?</h2>
        <p>Your personal data is shared with the client who initiates a search for personnel, based either on your consent or the 
          contract between us. Your personal data will be provided only to enable the client to ascertain if you are a good fit for
           the available position. With your consent or based on our contract, we may also conduct checks on you to verify the
           information you have provided and where we do this we may share your information with www.cvonline.co.uk</p>
 
        <h2>What legal basis do we have for using your information?</h2>
        <p>For prospective candidates, contractors, referees and clients, our processing is based either on contract (and
           pre-contractual dealings) or on our legitimate interests in processing personal data to be able to assess suitability
            for potential roles, to find potential candidates and to contact clients and referees.</p>
        <p>If you are interviewed and submitted as a candidate, then this may involve the processing of more detailed personal
               data, including sensitive data, such as health information, that you or others provide about you. In that case, we
                always ask for your consent before undertaking such processing.</p>
        <p>For clients, suppliers or other business contacts, we rely on our processing being necessary to perform a contract for
           you as a legal basis for our processing, for example, in contacting you to provide our services.</p>
 
         <h3>What happens if you do not provide us with the information we request or ask that we stop processing your information?</h3>
         <p>If you do not provide the personal data necessary, or withdraw your consent for the processing of your personal data, we may
          not be able to provide our services to you or match you with available job opportunities.</p>

          <h3>Do we make automated decisions concerning you?</h3>
          <p>No, we do not carry out automated profiling.</p>

          <h3>Do we use Cookies to collect personal data on you?</h3>
          <p>To provide better service to you on our websites, we use cookies to collect your personal data when you browse. See
             our cookie policy here for more details.</p>

          <h3>Do we transfer your data outside the EEA?</h3>
          <p>To better match your employee profile with current opportunities, we may transfer your personal data to clients and 
            partners in countries outside the EEA. These countries' privacy laws may be different from those in your home country.
             Where we transfer data to a country which has not been deemed to provide adequate data protection standards we always 
             have appropriate security measures and contractual safeguards in place to protect your personal data.</p>
          <p>This applies where we transfer your personal data for CV formatting to our trusted partner, an arrangement which is 
            governed by written data processing agreements and additional safeguards to ensure the security of all personal data.</p>
           <p>To find out more about how we safeguard your information as related to transfers, contact us at  info@domgys.com</p>
           
           <h3>What rights do you have in relation to the data we hold on you?</h3>
            <p>By law, you have a number of rights when it comes to your personal data.</p>
            <p>You have the right to:</p>
            <p>Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to 
              receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</p>
            <p>Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or
               inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</p>
            <p>Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is 
              no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal
               data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have
                processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons, which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</p>
            <p>Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party),
               and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground
                as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are 
                processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have
                 compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</p>
            <p>Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of
               your personal data in the following scenarios:</p>     
               <ol>
                <li>If you want us to establish the data’s accuracy.</li>
                <li>Where our use of the data is unlawful, but you do not want us to erase it.</li>
                <li> Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.</li>
                <li>You have objected to our use of your data, but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li> 
              </ol>
              <p>Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party 
                you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this 
                right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used 
                the information to perform a contract with you.</p>
                <p>Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will 
                  not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your
                   consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the 
                   case at the time you withdraw your consent.</p>
                <p>We usually act on requests and provide information free of charge within 30 days but may charge a reasonable
                     fee to cover our administrative costs of providing the information for baseless or excessive/repeated requests
                      or further copies of the same information.</p>
                <p>Alternatively, we may be entitled to refuse to act on the request where we believe it to be excessive, 
                        malicious or disingenuous.</p>
                 <p>Please consider your request responsibly before submitting it. We’ll respond as soon as we can. Generally, this
                   will be within one month from when we receive your request, but if the request is going to take longer to deal 
                   with, we’ll come back to you and let you know.</p>

             <h3>How will we contact you?</h3>  
             <p>We may contact you by phone, email or social media. If you prefer a particular contact means over another, please just let us know.</p>    

           <h3>How can you contact us?</h3>
           <p>If you are unhappy with how we’ve handled your information or would like to correct or update your information or
             exercise any of your other legal rights over your personal data, or if you have further questions on the processing 
             of your personal data, contact here: info@domgys.com</p>
